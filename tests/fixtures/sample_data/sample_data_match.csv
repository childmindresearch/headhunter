doc1,"This document contains headings that does not follow the expected markdown syntax.

# INITIAL ALL CAPS HEADING

For example this ## Heading 2 should be captured and the rest of this line should be its content.

This line should also continue to be content of Heading 2. Sometimes the headings are in bold like **heading 3** and they should also be captured correctly.

Other times, new lines get deleted by mistake and headings appear inline like this **Inline Heading:** with the rest of the line being its content.

But this line is just a normal sentence without any heading.

ANOTHER ALL CAPS HEADING WITHOUT MARKERS

Second all caps heading should be the same level as the initial one and this line should be considered its content.",A,1
doc2,"This is a second document with similar structure.

# INITIAL ALL CAPS HEADING

Here we have ## Heading 2 inline again with content after it.

More content continues. Bold headings like **heading 3** appear throughout.

Sometimes **Inline Heading:** appears mid-paragraph with text following.

Regular paragraph without headings here.

ANOTHER ALL CAPS HEADING WITHOUT MARKERS

This content belongs to the second all caps heading.",B,2
doc3,"Third document example with partial matches.

# INITIAL ALL CAPS HEADING

Third instance of ## Heading 2 extracted from content line.

Content paragraph. The **heading 3** pattern repeats here.

An **Inline Heading:** with its content on the same line.

Normal text paragraph.

SOME OTHER HEADING

This heading won't match the expected list.",C,3
